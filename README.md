# hello-world 

My name is Joseph and I'm originally from North Bergen, NJ, but joined the military a few years ago when I turned 18. I got my bachelor's degree from Western Governor's university in Cybersecurity while serving full-time on active duty. I mainly do IT, satellite internet, routing and switching, security compliance, and tactical communications! I started with python in a college class, but in my opinion it was kind of dry since it didn't revolve around building real things, but just python principles and I learn a lot better when I do tangible things as practice. I want to use github as a way to improve my coding, build real tangible things that add value, and connect with others!
